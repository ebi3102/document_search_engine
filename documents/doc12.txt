Language models for information
retrieval
A common suggestion to users for coming up with good queries is to think
of words that would likely appear in a relevant document, and to use those
words as the query. The language modeling approach to IR directly models
that idea: a document is a good match to a query if the document model
is likely to generate the query, which will in turn happen if the document
contains the query words often. This approach thus provides a different realization
of some of the basic ideas for document rankingwhich we sawin Section
6.2 (page 117). Instead of overtly modeling the probability P(R = 1|q, d)
of relevance of a document d to a query q, as in the traditional probabilistic
approach to IR (Chapter 11), the basic language modeling approach instead
builds a probabilistic language model Md from each document d, and
ranks documents based on the probability of themodel generating the query:
P(q|Md).
In this chapter, we first introduce the concept of language models (Section
12.1) and then describe the basic and most commonly used language
modeling approach to IR, the Query Likelihood Model (Section 12.2). After
some comparisons between the language modeling approach and other
approaches to IR (Section 12.3), we finish by briefly describing various extensions
to the language modeling approach (Section 12.4).
12.1 Language models
12.1.1 Finite automata and language models
What do we mean by a document model generating a query? A traditional
generative model of a language, of the kind familiar GENERATIVE MODEL from formal language
theory, can be used either to recognize or to generate strings. For example,
the finite automaton shown in Figure 12.1 can generate strings that include
the examples shown. The full set of strings that can be generated is called
the language of the automaton
