Web search basics
In this and the following two chapters, we consider web search engines. Sections
19.1–19.4 provide some background and history to help the reader appreciate
the forces that conspire to make the Web chaotic, fast-changing and
(from the standpoint of information retrieval) very different from the “traditional”
collections studied thus far in this book. Sections 19.5–19.6 deal with
estimating the number of documents indexed byweb search engines, and the
elimination of duplicate documents in web indexes, respectively. These two
latter sections serve as background material for the following two chapters.
19.1 Background and history
The Web is unprecedented in many ways: unprecedented in scale, unprecedented
in the almost-complete lack of coordination in its creation, and unprecedented
in the diversity of backgrounds and motives of its participants.
Each of these contributes to making web search different – and generally far
harder – than searching “traditional” documents.
The invention of hypertext, envisioned by Vannevar Bush in the 1940’s and
first realized in working systems in the 1970’s, significantly precedes the formation
of theWorldWideWeb (which we will simply refer to as theWeb), in
the 1990’s. Web usage has shown tremendous growth to the point where it
now claims a good fraction of humanity as participants, by relying on a simple,
open client-server design: (1) the server communicates with the client
via a protocol (the http or hypertext transfer protocol) HTTP that is lightweight and
simple, asynchronously carrying a variety of payloads (text, images and –
over time – richer media such as audio and video files) encoded in a simHTML
ple markup language called HTML (for hypertext markup language); (2) the
client – generally a browser, an application within a graphical user environment
– can ignore what it does not understand. Each of these seemingly
innocuous features has contributed enormously to the growth of theWeb, so
it is worthwhile to examine them further.
