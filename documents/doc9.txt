Relevance feedback and query
expansion
In most collections, the same concept may be referred to using different
words. This issue, known as synonymy, has an impact SYNONYMY on the recall of most
information retrieval systems. For example, you would want a search for
aircraft to match plane (but only for references to an airplane, not a woodworking
plane), and for a search on thermodynamics to match references to heat in
appropriate discussions. Users often attempt to address this problem themselves
by manually refining a query, as was discussed in Section 1.4; in this
chapter we discuss ways in which a system can help with query refinement,
either fully automatically or with the user in the loop.
The methods for tackling this problem split into two major classes: global
methods and local methods. Global methods are techniques for expanding
or reformulating query terms independent of the query and results returned
from it, so that changes in the query wording will cause the new query to
match other semantically similar terms. Global methods include:
• Query expansion/reformulationwith a thesaurus orWordNet (Section 9.2.2)
• Query expansion via automatic thesaurus generation (Section 9.2.3)
• Techniques like spelling correction (discussed in Chapter 3)
Local methods adjust a query relative to the documents that initially appear
to match the query. The basic methods here are:
• Relevance feedback (Section 9.1)
• Pseudo relevance feedback, also known as Blind relevance feedback (Section
9.1.6)
• (Global) indirect relevance feedback (Section 9.1.7)
In this chapter, we will mention all of these approaches, but we will concentrate
on relevance feedback,which is one of the most used and most successful
approaches.
