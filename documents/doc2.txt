The term vocabulary and postings
lists
Recall the major steps in inverted index construction:
1. Collect the documents to be indexed.
2. Tokenize the text.
3. Do linguistic preprocessing of tokens.
4. Index the documents that each term occurs in.
In this chapter we first briefly mention how the basic unit of a document can
be defined and how the character sequence that it comprises is determined
(Section 2.1). We then examine in detail some of the substantive linguistic
issues of tokenization and linguistic preprocessing, which determine the
vocabulary of terms which a system uses (Section 2.2). Tokenization is the
process of chopping character streams into tokens, while linguistic preprocessing
then deals with building equivalence classes of tokens which are the
set of terms that are indexed. Indexing itself is covered in Chapters 1 and 4.
Then we return to the implementation of postings lists. In Section 2.3, we
examine an extended postings list data structure that supports faster querying,
while Section 2.4 covers building postings data structures suitable for
handling phrase and proximity queries, of the sort that commonly appear in
both extended Boolean models and on the web.
2.1 Document delineation and character sequence decoding
2.1.1 Obtaining the character sequence in a document
Digital documents that are the input to an indexing process are typically
bytes in a file or on a web server. The first step of processing is to convert this
byte sequence into a linear sequence of characters. For the case of plain English
text in ASCII encoding, this is trivial. But often things get much more
