Flat clustering
Clustering algorithms group a set of documents into subsets CLUSTER or clusters. The
algorithms’ goal is to create clusters that are coherent internally, but clearly
different fromeach other. In other words, documents within a cluster should
be as similar as possible; and documents in one cluster should be as dissimilar
as possible from documents in other clusters.

UNSUPERVISED Clustering is the most common form of unsupervised learning. No super-
LEARNING vision means that there is no human expert who has assigned documents
to classes. In clustering, it is the distribution and makeup of the data that
will determine cluster membership. A simple example is Figure 16.1. It is
visually clear that there are three distinct clusters of points. This chapter and
Chapter 17 introduce algorithms that find such clusters in an unsupervised
fashion.
The difference between clustering and classification may not seem great
at first. After all, in both cases we have a partition of a set of documents
into groups. But as we will see the two problems are fundamentally different.
Classification is a form of supervised learning (Chapter 13, page 256):
our goal is to replicate a categorical distinction that a human supervisor im
