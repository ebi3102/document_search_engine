Boolean retrieval
The meaning of the term information retrieval can be very broad. Just getting
a credit card out of your wallet so that you can type in the card number
is a form of information retrieval. However, as an academic field of study,
information retrieval INFORMATION might be defined thus:
RETRIEVAL
Information retrieval (IR) is finding material (usually documents) of
an unstructured nature (usually text) that satisfies an information need
from within large collections (usually stored on computers).
As defined in this way, information retrieval used to be an activity that only
a few people engaged in: reference librarians, paralegals, and similar professional
searchers. Now the world has changed, and hundreds of millions
of people engage in information retrieval every day when they use a web
search engine or search their email.1 Information retrieval is fast becoming
the dominant form of information access, overtaking traditional databasestyle
searching (the sort that is going on when a clerk says to you: “I’msorry,
I can only look up your order if you can give me your Order ID”).
IR can also cover other kinds of data and information problems beyond
that specified in the core definition above. The term “unstructured data”
refers to datawhich does not have clear, semantically overt, easy-for-a-computer
structure. It is the opposite of structured data, the canonical example of
which is a relational database, of the sort companies usually use to maintain
product inventories and personnel records. In reality, almost no data
are truly “unstructured”. This is definitely true of all text data if you count
the latent linguistic structure of human languages. But even accepting that
the intended notion of structure is overt structure, most text has structure,
such as headings and paragraphs and footnotes, which is commonly represented
in documents by explicit markup (such as the coding underlying web
